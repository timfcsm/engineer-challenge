Setup the same as in [original readme](./_Readme.md) 

## General questions

- How much time did you spend working on the solution?

  I spent around 5 hours in total

- Whatâ€™s the part of the solution you are most proud of?
  
  I think the solution is very simple, so I can't answer this question :D
  
- If you had more time, what other things you would like to do?

  I'd like to write more styles for well-looking design, add more functionality for form components and write more tests.
  I believe I did as much as it's enough to show which approaches and concepts I use in my work, but the solution is far from perfect
  
- Do you have any feedback regarding this coding challenge?  

  The initial setup worked perfectly and it's clearly explained
